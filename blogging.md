#### Some guidelines for writing blog posts:

- Blog posts do not have to be long! Quality over length.
- Choose a *specific topic* and dive into it. A blog post on "How to Format Your Command Line Prompt" will likely be more enticing than a generic post on "The Command Line."
- At least two of your posts should be technical posts that include code snippets.
- Think of snappy titles!
- Use gifs! Everyone likes gifs.
- Be yourself. Even though you're writing blog posts on technical topics, your posts can and should assume your own voice.

### Why blog?

> Keeping a technical blog can be a great way of documenting your growth as a developer.

>This documentation can be particularly useful on a professional level. All software companies want to hire smart, thoughtful, communicative developers who can easily assimilate into a team, and who are ready to both teach and learn. Your technical blog is empirical evidence of all of these qualities.

Learning to code in twelve weeks will be challenging, and you will run into concepts that you don't understand at first. These are the perfect topics for blog posts – if you work through a problem and write about it in detail, you will develop both a greater understanding for the concept at hand AND a reference material that you can refer to later.

There is **so much cool stuff** to explore and blog about. Be hungry for knowledge. Dive in.

### Medium.com

[Medium.com](https://medium.com/) is a great platform for your blog to live! If you already keep a blog, feel free to use that as an alternative.
